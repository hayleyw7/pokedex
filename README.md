## Abstract

* The PoKedeX App is a Progressive Web Application that gives a user the ability to search through Generation 1 Pokemon and quickly find information on them. This will be a very useful app for someone who is in a real life Poke-battle and needs to find quick information about Pokemon, even without internet service!

- PoKedeX: As a user, when I visit the app, I should be able to search for Pokemon by name.
- PoKedeX: As a user, when I visit the app on a computer or tablet, I should be able to see a display of all Pokemon.
- Help: As a user, when I visit the app, I have a "help" button, and if I click it, I can access a page that explains how to use the app.
- PokemonDetails: As a user, I should be able to access a page that contains a Pokemon's details by either a) clicking their image or b) searching for their name, and no other Pokemon details or images should be visible.
- PokemonDetails & Help: As a user, I should be able to return to the PoKedeX from any other page.

This project was a group project for Turing School of Software & Design during module 3. [The project rubric is linked here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html)

*Hi! My name is [Joana](https://github.com/joanafbrito) and I am a current Front End Engineering student at Turing School of Software Design. I am a career changer! I've  spent the last decade working to manage two small business, and grabbing the opportunity to move to another country.* 
*Now, I'm spending my days learning code. As a woman I can contribuit to build a more balanced society, where people can be seen as equals in the software marketing and where I can build apps more inclusive and make a difference using this huge platform of the internet!*
