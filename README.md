## Abstract

* The PoKedeX App is a Progressive Web Application that gives a user the ability to search through Generation 1 Pokemon and quickly find information on them. 
* When offline, the user will have complete access to the application features as well as any Pokemon information that has been successfully queried prior to going offline.
* This will be a very useful app for someone who is in a real life Poke-battle and needs to find quick information about Pokemon, even without internet service!

[Deployment Link](https://pokedex-git-main-matt-roden.vercel.app/)

- PoKedeX: As a user, when I visit the app, I should be able to search for Pokemon by name.
- PoKedeX: As a user, when I visit the app on a computer or tablet, I should be able to see a display of all Pokemon.
- How To: As a user, when I visit the app, I have a "How To" button, and if I click it, I can access a page that explains how to use the app.
- PokemonDetails: As a user, I should be able to access a page that contains a Pokemon's details by searching for their `name` or `ID (1-151)`. 
- PokemonDetails & Help: As a user, I should be able to return to the PoKedeX from any other page.

This project was a group project for Turing School of Software & Design during module 3. [The project rubric is linked here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html)


## A Little Bit About the Developers

Hi! My name is [Joana](https://github.com/joanafbrito)!👩🏻‍💻🌴  I am a current Front End Engineering student at Turing School of Software Design. I am a career changer! I've  spent the last decade working to manage two small business, and grabbing the opportunity to move to another country.*
*Now, I'm spending my days learning code. As a woman I can contribute to build a more balanced society, where people can be seen as equals in the software marketing and where I can build apps more inclusive and make a difference using this huge platform of the internet!

Hi, I'm [Hayley](https://github.com/hayleyw7)! 🐰🌻🐱  I enjoy combining my experience with software development, art, the cannabis industry, community organization, & start-ups. During the last decade, I managed teams who launched successful new businesses, including multiple dispensaries and an analytical testing laboratory network. While outside of the office, I used the skills garnered from cannabis industry experience to co-found two organizations: a grassroots political enterprise & a worker's rights advocation association. I recognized a lack of representation and resources in these roles, which motivated me to help my community by getting an education in front-end development. My propensity for empathy, design, and accessibility have led me to place considerable focus on a variety of user experiences and representation.

Info about [Matt](https://github.com/Matt-Roden) 🎸  :  I'm a software developer with a passion for accessibility and designing tools that are delightful to use. I have a strong interest in learning and implementing new technologies and tools. My backround in Mechatronics and Engineering as a Field Service Technician for an industrial manufacturer allowed me to expand on my passion for learning and allowed for implementation on the fly. I also gained the experience to travel globally,  and I enjoy learning about different cultures and perspectives and then finding ways to integrate this knowledge into my own life in order to become a more well rounded person.

Outside of Software Development, I have a passion for music and music technology, hiking mountains, finding and cruising skateparks, and hanging out with my loved ones and dog! 🛹 🦮
